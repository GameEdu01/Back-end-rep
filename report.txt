So here ill explain you basic requests in my api
---------------------------------------------------------

We start with that, we want to sign up
To do that, we use /api/signup as a post request

{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "email": "string"
}

If in return we get our token and congrats message, then we have
sucessfully added ourselfes to the database

When user is created, it is automatically is_active by default,
but after certain amount of time our session expires, and only way
to access data (only ours for now), is to make a new session, this
can be avoided by making basic request and using /api/update_session_expire_date

{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}

But if it happenes that we don't use any of those in a long period of time,
our session gets completely expired and we can not update it now, and the only 
way to continue using our account is to create a new session with /api/new_session

{
  "username": "string",
  "session": "string"
}

this request would NOT work if you already have a working session in your account

after you use /api/new_session, you automatically is_acitve = true, and there is no 
need to use /api/set_user_active_with_session in order to access data
